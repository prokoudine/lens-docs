The documentation has just been updated to match recent development in both the web app and the FreeCAD addon.

<!--more-->

What's changed:

- Homepage has been updated to provide background about the project.
- New section, Administration, now covers the basics of running your own Ondsel Lens server. This is partly a port of existing documentation written by Amritpal Singkh, and partly new content by Aleksandr Prokudin.
- New section, FreeCAD addon, now covers the functional parts of the addon (as some of the parts don't yet work since the company's shutdown).
- New page, Contributors, now lists both original Ondsel Lens team members, new contributors, and authors of this documentation.
- New section, News, contains project's blog posts covering the development of Lens since Ondsel's shutdown.
- The top menu has been updated to link to documentation, news, and the list of contributors
- A top banner has been added to link to the most recent blog entry.

This work was sponsored from the Ondsel Onward fund via the FreeCAD Project Association. The second part of the grant work will involve documenting the next batch of changes in both the web app and the addon.
