Pieter Hijma got an NLnet grant to improve the Lens addon.

<!--more-->

The [grant](https://nlnet.nl/project/Lens-FreeCAD-integration/) covers improvements in both FreeCAD and the Lens addon, all intended to improve the workflow for collaboration on mechanical designs.

Think annotations, versioning, better support for remote parts, better UX, etc. See Peter's [blog post](https://pieterhijma.net/blog.html) for details.
