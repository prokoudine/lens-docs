The Ondsel Lens addon provides basic navigation over workspaces available to a user.

By the default, the **Workspaces** lists workspaces from all organizations that a user is member of. The name in bold is the name of the workspace, the name in the parentheses is the organization this workspace belongs to.

To go one level back, click on the left-pointing arrow above the list of files and directories. The caption to the right of the button displays the full path to the currently open directory.
