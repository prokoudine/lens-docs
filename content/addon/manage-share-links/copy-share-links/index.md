To copy a share link to the clipboard, follow these steps:

1. Select a file and then its share link.

2. Click on the **Copy** button to the right of the share link (the left one in a group of three) and select one of the three options in the menu.

- **Direct Link**: This copies just the share link URL to the clipboard.

- **Share in FreeCAD forum**: This copies embed code for FreeCAD's phpBB-based forum. The embed will render the model in the forum, so any forum visitor can rotate the view and pan around the model.

- **Embed**: This copies HTML embed code ready to insert into any website page.
