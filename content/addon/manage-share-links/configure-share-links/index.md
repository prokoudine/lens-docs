To change parameters of a share link, follow these steps:

1. Select a file and then its share link.

2. Click on the button with a gear icon to the right of the share link (the middle one in a group of three).

3. This will open the share link settings dialog. It's almost identical to the dialog you see when you create a new share link, with the following exceptions:

- An additional **Enabled** checkbox is displayed at the top, so that you can temporarily disable a share link without deleting it.
- The protection method cannot be changed. However, for the PIN protection method, you can change the PIN code.

For an explanation of all available options, please [see here](../create-share-links/).

4. After changing available parameters, click on **OK**. Changes will take effect immediately.
