Bookmarks are shortcuts to public share links on the Ondsel Server. They are saved in the web app and made visible for all members of the currently selected organization.

The Ondsel Lens addon for FreeCAD can display all bookmarks for all organizations you are part of on the currently selected server.

To view available bookmarks, switch to the **Bookmarks** tab of the Ondsel lens window.

To open a bookmarked share link in FreeCAD, simply double-cick on a bookmark.
