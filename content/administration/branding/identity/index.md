### Set the logo and favicon

Click on the camera icon for **Select Logo File** and point your browser to the logo file in SVG or PNG file format. The logo will be displayed in the navigation sidebar on the left and on the homepage.

Repeat this for **Select Favicon File**. This is the small version of the logo that will be displayed in the browser tab next to the server's title.

Once you select both images, the dashboard will render the preview below, next to the current logo and favicon.
